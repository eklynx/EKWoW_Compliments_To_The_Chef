#Compliments to the Chef
###### an EKLynx quick World of Warcraft add-on

Back in the days of WeakAruas, someone created an aura that did something small and silly, but it was popular. Many others created clones that changes what was said, and life was just a bit more entertaining when raiding. But with the great add-on cleansing of 2026 WeakAuras rode off in to the sunset.  But this small thing was a popular request and seemed manageable for a small add-on by itself, and this is the result!

This add-on does two simple things.
1. When you start eating, you say something
2. When you gain or refresh a well-fed buff, you say something else.

That's it!

What is said can be easily changed in the add-on settings page, and every character has its own settings.

It's that simple!
